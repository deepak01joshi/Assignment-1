This means that when you created a dictionary, the order in which you inserted items was not necessarily the order in which they were stored or retrieved. In other words, dictionaries did not maintain any inherent order between the keys.\n",

They were implemented using hash tables, and the internal structure of a hash table does not preserve the order of insertion. The main focus was on efficient lookups by key, not on maintaining order.\n",
