The meaning of oriented is interested in a particular kind of thing or entity. In layman's terms, it is a programming pattern that rounds around an object or entity are called object-oriented programming."

When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated (i.e. an object is created) memory is allocated. An object has an identity, state, and behavior. Each object contains data and code to manipulate the data. Objects can interact without having to know details of each other’s data or code, it is sufficient to know the type of message accepted and type of response returned by the objects.\n",

Direct access to some components of an object is restricted while controlled access is provided through methods. Objects should be designed to hide the internal implementation details and expose only what is needed to interact with them from the outside.\n",

It allows you to represent essential features of an object while hiding unnecessary details. It helps manage complexity by separating what an object does (methods) from how it achieves it (implementation details).\n"
